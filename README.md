Note: for deployment links if you encounter bad request error, try to refresh the page periodically. It happen sometimes because i choose free plan. Free plan on Render.com said the service will periodically shutting down and started again only if there are user accessing the link. It will takes around 2-5 minutes to start the deployment services. So if you encounter long time loading or bad request error, wait for minutes or refresh the page.
